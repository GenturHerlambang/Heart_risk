# Heart Attack Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual surviving from a heart attack using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook h8dsft_P1G3_Gentur_Herlambang.ipynb contains the detailed steps taken to explore, preprocess, model, and evaluate the heart attack dataset.


# Introduction
Heart attacks are a critical health condition, and predicting the likelihood of survival can assist medical professionals in making informed decisions and providing timely interventions. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict the probability of survival after a heart attack based on various factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is available at Heart Attack Dataset. It contains information about individuals who have experienced heart attacks, including features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and the target variable indicating survival status.

# Key Steps
The project involves the following key steps:

- Data Exploration: Perform an initial exploration of the heart attack dataset to understand its structure, features, and the distribution of survival cases.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Feature Selection: Select relevant features that are likely to impact survival rates and remove any redundant or irrelevant ones.
- Model Building: Build a machine learning model, such as logistic regression, decision tree classifier, or random forest classifier, to predict survival probabilities based on the selected features.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Prediction and Insights: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data and analyze the results to gain insights into the factors that significantly affect the likelihood of survival after a heart attack.
